# Student Record Management System

This project is a simple student record management system that allows you to store and manage student records. It provides functionalities to add new records, delete existing records, and search for records based on the city.
The project is implemented in C++.

## How it Works
The program provides a menu-based interface where you can choose different options to perform various operations on the student records. Here's how it works:

1. **Add a Record**: Allows you to add a new student record by entering the necessary information, including roll number, name, parent names, semester, branch, and address.

2. **Delete a Record**: Lets you delete a student record by providing the roll number of the student.

3. **Search by City**: Allows you to search for student records based on the city. Enter the city name, and the program will display the records of students belonging to that city.

4. **Exit**: Terminates the program and exits.

To use the program, follow the on-screen prompts and select the desired option from the menu. The program will perform the corresponding operation and provide feedback accordingly.
